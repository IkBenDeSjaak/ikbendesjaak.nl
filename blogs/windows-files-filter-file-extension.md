I had a large folder on my Windows computer with files from different types, but I only wanted to see the files with a specific extension. So the question was how to achieve this.

The solution for this turned out to be quite simple! Follow the next steps to only see files with a `.jpg` extension.

1. Open file explorer.
2. Navigate to the folder in which you want to see the files of a specific extension.
3. Type `ext:.jpg` in the search bar.  

In the example above the `ext:` specifies that you want to filter by extension and after that you have to write the extension you want to search on. This is not limited to `.jpg`.
